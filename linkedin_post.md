# 🚀 Built an AI-Powered Engineering Manager Code Review Agent in Just 2 Hours!

## The Problem
As an EM, I was drowning in code reviews - 30+ minutes per PR, repetitive feedback, and missing strategic insights. There had to be a better way.

## The Solution
Built an **AI code review assistant** that automatically:
- 🔍 Analyzes git diffs and generates detailed review comments
- 📋 Creates strategic PR summaries (What/Why, Risks, Actions)  
- 🎯 Checks for anti-patterns and team principles
- ⚡ One command: `python auto_review.py --provider openai --model gpt-4`

## The Magic
**Built entirely with Cursor** in just 2 hours using prompt engineering! The AI assistance helped me:
- Rapidly prototype git diff generation
- Build robust error handling
- Create clean, modular architecture
- Write comprehensive docs

## Key Wins
✨ **30min → 30sec**: What used to take forever now happens instantly
✨ **Multi-LLM support**: OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama - choose your poison
✨ **Git-native**: Works with branches, commits, staged changes
✨ **Customizable**: Adapts to your team's review criteria

## Tech Stack
Python + LangGraph + Git integration + Multiple LLM providers

## Why This Matters
This isn't about replacing human judgment - it's about amplifying it. Now I focus on strategic decisions and team mentorship while AI handles the routine.
